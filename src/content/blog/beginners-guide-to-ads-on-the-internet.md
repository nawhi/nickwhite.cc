I love the internet - I work in tech, after all, so I make my living from and on it. But maybe you share a nagging feeling I have, that my phone and computer are using you as much as you are using them.

If so, here are some simple steps you can take to bring your internet life back to a healthier place. All these steps require no technical experience, and are designed to be accessible and valuable for developers and non-developers alike.

## Step 1: Install an ad blocker

This is the single best way to improve your internet experience. If you do nothing else, do this!

**_Your task:_ Install and start using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), on desktop and mobile.** Brave is almost identical to Chrome, but has built-in ad, tracking, and cookie blockers through its Shields feature.

If you can't switch your desktop browser at the moment, install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin), an ad-blocking extension with similar functionality.

When you run an ad blocker, you'll notice that everything loads and runs much faster, because ad scripts place load on your browser. If you're easily distracted, you may find you feel less tired after a session on the internet, because it has become easier to focus without being semi-distracted by noisy background ads.

## Step 2: Opt out of personalised advertising

All ad companies are legally required (in the UK at least) to have an anonymous mode in which they collect no data about you. They are often buried in the settings, but they're always there and able to be turned on.

**Your task:**

1. **Turn off ad personalisation in Google Ad Center** here: [https://myadcenter.google.com/](https://myadcenter.google.com/). If you have a Google account, sign in and turn it off in there too. (While you are there you may actually _want_ to personalise your ads - ads aren't all bad - but it's worth knowing how to turn it off so you are in control.)
2. **Turn off ad personalisation in AdChoices**, a collective of Google and hundreds of other ad networks, here: https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices
3. **Repeat** for any other social media or software services you use often, on all the devices that you most commonly use to access the internet.
4. **Check** every few months - personalisation settings have a surprising habit of turning themselves back on.

When you went into Google Ad Center, you may have seen the section where Google displays everything it knows about you. (Edit 2023: I don't know if this is still there, as mine have been turned off for years). This gives you a picture of the data Google has about you, and you can see how detailed it is and whether you think it's accurate or not.

Want to go further? Consider switching to a privacy-focused search engine like [Startpage](https://startpage.com), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). These collect less personal data than Bing or Google, at the cost of search results that are sometimes less useful.

## Step 3: Learn to spot ads

Ad blockers don’t block everything. You will still see:

- _sponsored search results_ designed to look like bona-fide search results, but which were actually paid for instead of being organically relevant to your query
- _sponsored content_ also known as "natural ads", these are bits of the webpage styled to look like the regular page/blog/recipe/article but which were actually paid for
- _affiliate links_ links to products from otherwise impartial blogs and news articles that will earn the host a small commission if you buy the product

**_Your task:_ When browsing the internet, ask yourself: what on this page is an advertisement?** 

If it's a search result, is it there because it's most relevant to your query, or because someone paid to put it there? If it's a link, is it there because the host gets a commission if you buy it?

It's important not to become completely cynical - after all, advertisements and affiliate programs are far older than the internet. But if you're getting free content, then more often than not you're paying for it somehow. 

## Step 5: Understand what a good search looks like

By now, you'll be good at spotting what is an ad, and what is not, when using search engines.

Unfortunately, even if you only use these non-ad search results (known as "organic" search results), the way that these results are served to you are still highly influenced by factors that probably don’t align with your objectives.

For instance, Google Maps results are ranked in part by how often the business owner updates their opening times. Useful, sure - but when I'm looking for breakfast, I care more that it's tasty than that its opening hours have been updated recently.

**_Your task:_ Use search engines for facts, not for opinions.**

This is best demonstrated by example.

### Searches that the internet is absolutely ideal for

_"Pharmacy near Woking station open now"_<br/>
_"Bicycle hire in London"_<br/>
_"What country are peacocks native to"_<br/>
_"Diameter of Jupiter"_

These are good searches because they represent facts that are easy to verify, and therefore likely to be correct. They also presumably represent things that would have small consequences if the answer was incorrect. (If you are asked for the diameter of Jupiter at gunpoint, look it up in a book!)

### Searches that the internet is pretty good for, with some caveats

_"Best way to clean a wine stain off a carpet"_<br/>
_"Restaurant nearby open now"_

These will probably get you to a solution, but you may have to trawl through a lot of sales pitches ("You can't possibly clean a wine stain off a carpet _yourself_... call Carpet Cleaning 101 for a free quote!"), and you may not end up with the best solution (e.g. a restaurant that spends more time updating their opening hours than cooking nice food).

### Searches that the internet is terrible for

_"Mental health support"._
As of early 2023, Google's highest _three_ results for this are companies offering paid therapy. There is a risk here that one could end up getting sold something when help is available for free. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123; other good organisations offering free support include [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helplines/), [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net/help/get-help/) and [Shout](https://www.giveusashout.org/) - and of course you can always speak to your GP instead, or filter your search to the NHS website by adding `site:nhs.uk`.

_"The best Chinese restaurant in Bedford"._ Reviews are SO gameable - that's an article for another time. Plus, ironically, when everyone searches for "the best X", they all pile in to just a few restaurants - which stresses the restaurants' capacity and usually makes the experience worse. You'll know this if you've ever been to a "viral brunch spot", queued for hours, then actually had a pretty average meal.

_“How to lose weight / gain muscle / learn Spanish / etc fast”._ You can’t do any of these things fast, and you probably know that. By definition, then, the results will mostly be snake oil.

_“Should I take X drug”,_ or other medical advice. Ask a GP instead, or filter your search to the NHS website by adding `site:nhs.uk`. As a general rule, if you are accessing specialist information for free, someone somewhere is paying for that service: if it's not you or the government, it will probably be an advertiser of some sort. Genuinely useful free informaiton is out there, but it's rare and hard to find.

A bad search meets any of the following criteria: (1) there could be a substantial risk of harm if the results are incorrect or misleading; (2) you are not in a frame of mind where you can critically interpret the results; (3) you would spend less time figuring the result out if you just used your own intuition and problem-solving skills.
