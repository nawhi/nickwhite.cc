# nickwhite.cc

The source code for my website, [nickwhite.cc](https://nickwhite.cc).

It is based on the [devfolio template by Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio), and built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Pre 2023, this website was built with SvelteKit - the source code for the old website can be found [here](https://github.com/nawhi/nickwhite.cc-old).
